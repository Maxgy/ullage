# First we try to print a value out
print 1234 # => 1234

# then we check that printing a value returns the correct result
print print print 1969 # => 1969
                       # => 1969
                       # => 1969

# Printing of string literals
print 'foo' # => foo

# Type info is tracked through variable assignments
let bar = 'bar'
print bar # => bar

# Type info is tracked through function calls
fn print_str(s: String): String
   print s
end

print_str('hello') # => hello
