# Types

We want the following built in types:

 * Integer/Number (arbitary precision?)
 * String
 * Array
 * Function
 * Tuples, (including the unit tuple?)

There is also the biltin type `Any`, which all types will inherit
from?

Given generics he following can be built from those primitives:

 * Map
 * Linked list
 * Range
